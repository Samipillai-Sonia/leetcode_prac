Table point holds the x coordinate of some points on x-axis in a plane, which are all integers.
 

Write a query to find the shortest distance between two points in these points.
 

| x   |
|-----|
| -1  |
| 0   |
| 2   |
 

The shortest distance is '1' obviously, which is from point '-1' to '0'. So the output is as below:
 

| shortest|
|---------|
| 1       |
 

Note: Every point is unique, which means there is no duplicates in table point.
 

Follow-up: What if all these points have an id and are arranged from the left most to the right most of x axis?
 
select abs(t1.x-t2.x) as shortest
from point t1
join point t2
where t1.x != t2.x
order by shortest asc limit 1;
